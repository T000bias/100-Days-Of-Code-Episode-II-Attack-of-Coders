    <li>Connect with software engineers on social media</li>
  </ul>
    <h3> Summary </h3>
    <p> I finished class 7 and connected with some people on LinkedIn and Twitter. Thinking about streaming this    process until completion. Within this time frame, 100Devs would be finished. A funny thing happened in my coffee chat today. The byte logic guy wanted me to share my pay from work with him. Essentially, I would handle all the meetings and in-person events and he would handle all the coding portion. This is by far the craziest thing I have ever been offered. Didn't get all my task done, but thats okay

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Today was short. I watched a Kevin Powell video on CUBE CSS and did some freeCodeCamp challenges. Additionally, from here on out I will be uploading Frontend Mentor challenges to all my social media account (Linkedin, Twitter, facebook).
